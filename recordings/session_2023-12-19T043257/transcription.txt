It was reported at that time that you had a number of meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, who, when you met him 10 years ago, he was convicted of soliciting prostitution from minors. What did you know about him when you were meeting with him, as you've said yourself, in the hopes of raising money? You know, I had dinners with him. I regret doing that. He had relationships with people he said would give to global health, which is an interest I have. Not nearly enough philanthropy goes in that direction. Those meetings were a mistake. They didn't result in what he purported, and I cut them off. That goes back a long time ago now, so there's nothing new on that. It was reported that you continued to meet with him over several years, and that, in other words, a number of meetings. What did you do when you found out about his background? Well, you know, I've said I regretted having those dinners, and there's nothing, absolutely nothing new on that. Is there a lesson for you, for anyone else looking at this? Well, he's dead, so, you know, in general, you always have to be careful, and, you know, I'm very proud of what we've done in philanthropy, very proud of the work of the foundation. You know, that's what I get up every day and focus on.
